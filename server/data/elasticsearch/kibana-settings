Added "lowercase_expanded_terms":false to query:queryString:options
Reason: exception.stackTrace field is not analyzed, so it gets stored as-is. So when we searched on it using kibana, then the search term used to get converted to lower case and then this lower case term used to get searched within exception.stackTrace yielding 0 results. For example, if exception.stackTrace had "java.lang.NullPointerException", then searching for "java*Null*" OR "java*null*" did not yield any results because the search query got converted to “java*null*” and the string to be searched had “Null” in upper case (in its un-analyzed original form)
